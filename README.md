- Prevent cross site scripting - XSS
- Prevent NoSQL injections
- Add a rate limit for requests of 100 requests per 10 minutes
- Protect against http param polution
- Add headers for security (helmet)
- Use cors to make API public (for now)

## Code Related Suggestions
- NPM scripts for dev and production env
- Config file for important constants
- Use controller methods with documented descriptions/routes
- Error handling middleware
- Authentication middleware for protecting routes and setting user roles
- Validation using Mongoose and no external libraries
- Use async/await (create middleware to clean up controller methods)
- Create a database seeder to import and destroy data
